# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project applies machine learning (KMeans Clustering) to group mall customers into different categories based on their "Annual Income" and "Spending Score".

✅ This is my first Data Science project, made as part of an internship requirement and to start building my GitHub portfolio.

## 📁 Files Included

 File Description 
 `Mall_Customers.csv`  -Dataset used for customer segmentation 
 `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`  -Final notebook with code, analysis, clustering, and visualizations 

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze customer behavior and group them into meaningful clusters based on their:
- Annual income
- Spending patterns

This helps businesses:
- Understand different types of customers
- Plan personalized marketing strategies

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- GitHub

---

## 🔍 What Was Done

- Imported and explored the dataset
- Cleaned and visualized the data
- Applied the "Elbow Method" to find the optimal number of clusters
- Performed "KMeans Clustering"
- Visualized final customer segments with scatter plots

---

## 📈 Final Output

The model grouped customers into "5 clusters" that represent different spending/income behaviors. Each cluster was visualized with color-coded plots for clear understanding.
